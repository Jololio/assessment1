/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does.

    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

const gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is a code cloud service that allows programmers to upload their own programs and code to the internet to be downloaded and used by other people or themselves should they need it. (i.e. getting a new computer with none of your files on it)"

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitInitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git init' does.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitInitDefinition = "git init is the command that first initializes the repository within the folder where your code is, to allow it to be sent to github"

//////////////////PROBLEM 4////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCloneDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git clone' does.
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitStatusDefinition'.

//CODE HERE
const gitStatusDefinition = "git status tells you the status of files in your repository, and tells you if there are changes to be committed, or if the file has no changes and is fine"

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitAddDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git add' does.

    Create another variable called 'gitAddCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to add all files.
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitAddDefinition = "git add is the way to add a specific file to git so it can actually be tracked and have the changes noticed"
const gitAddCode = "git add ."

//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitCommitDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git commit' does.

    Create a variable called 'gitCommitCode'.  
    It should be a string containing the code to commit using the message "initial commit".
*/

//CODE HERE
const gitCommitDefinition = "git commit is the command to create a new updated version of the code that saves all the new changes you have made, and can be paired with a message to say what exactly has changed."
const gitCommitCode = "git commit -m 'initial commit'"

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitPushDefinition'.  
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what 'git push' does.
